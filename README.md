# MultiThreading and MultiProcessing lightning talk
this LT talk is about Multi-threading and Multi-processing which is fundamental concepts in computer science that help to speed processing up by using Concurrency & parallelism which are two intelligent techniques that are used to prevent wasting CPU time and make use of modern multi-core computers, I also decided to include a python example to show Multi-threading and multi-processing, I chose python for two reasons the first, because of how valuable this language is in data science and the second is because it embraces an interesting limitation called Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which prevents processes from having two or more parallel threads unlike other well-known programming languages like (java,c++,…) which are direct and more intuitive when it comes to Multi-threading and Multi-processing.
